# ScriptSee-QR-Code-2.0
Quad Rotor - Code - 2.0

Project Drone sederhana.
Just wanted to fly a QuadRotor UAV with an AI-AIan inside

Writted on Python Language
.
.
.
n Deprecated Dronekit Libraries wkwkwk. 

But it's still works n effectively can be used with latest Arducopter firmware btw

Requirements:
- Python
- dronekit libraries
- SITL(Software in The Loop) Simulator (dronekit-sitl or Ardupilot with Mission Planner)

How to use:
- Start SITL Simulator, use either Ardupilot SITL or dronekit-sitl, skip this step if you want run this script on on-board companion computer
- Modify 'koneksi.py', adjust the connect string with the connection method you are using(TCP/UDP, or directly to your Copter)
- If you want specific mission, just make your own algorithm, mission sequence, or whatever you want in main.py

ATTENTION!!!
I MADE THIS README FOR MYSELF, so be CAREFUL when you use it on your own vehicle

Any Question?
